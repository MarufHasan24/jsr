# JSR

jsr stands for "JavaScript Reverse". It is a programming language that is partially identical to JavaScript, but with the syntax reversed. For example, the following code in JavaScript:

```js
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
console.log(z);
```

would be written in jsr as:

```jsr
print(z);
velt z = y + x;
velt y = 6;
velt x = 5;
#include <std>
```

Speciality of this language is it runs from bottom to top. It is that it is written in JavaScript and it is interpreted in JavaScript. It is a very simple language but hard to code. It is not meant to be used for anything serious. It is just a fun project.
